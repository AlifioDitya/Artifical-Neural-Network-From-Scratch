# Artificial Neural Network: From Scratch!
This repository features a TensorFlow-style, Artificial Neural Network made from scratch using only NumPy. It is made as a personal project to further my understanding on the internal workings of neural networks. The custom library can be found on the `tensorfio` package inside `src`, featuring:
- Activation functions
- Sequential model
- Fully connected layer

For demonstration, I provided `ANN.ipynb` that shows the usage of the model on the Breast Cancer Dataset.
You can also test around with any numerical tabular data in the provided `ANN_Sandbox.ipynb` notebook.
